### Commom algorithms implementations in Go

---

A couple years ago I saw someone commenting on a Youtube video that everyone is badass until faces data strucutres and algorithms. This repo is meant to show that is by knowing data structures and algorithms that one become a real badass.

Maybe this sounds cringe... Anyways!!! 

The study of data strucutres and algorithms is quite important and I hope some of the code here might help you. Happy studying!
